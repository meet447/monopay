# SolUPI On-Chain Programs (Planned)

Target: Anchor program(s) for split settlement and optional delegation policy.

## Planned instructions
1. `create_split`
2. `join_split`
3. `settle_split_share`
4. `close_split`
5. `authorize_delegate` (optional, based on final session-key approach)

## Planned next step
Create `Anchor.toml` and initial program crate once gateway/mobile flow is stable.
